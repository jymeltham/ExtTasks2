                Your goal is to implement a program that takes a series of strings (one per line) and

                Write a program to count the number years in a range that has a repeated digit.
                For example, 2012 has a repeated digit, but 2013 does not.

            /* Task 3: Of Mice and Men 
            * 
               Have the programme allow a user to play the “mice and men” game. The game works like this:
                Randomly generate a 4-digit number. Ask the user to guess a 4-digit number. For every digit that the user guessed correctly 
                in the correct place, they have a “mouse”. For every digit the user guessed correctly in the wrong place is a “man” 
                Every time the user makes a guess, tell them how many “mice” and “men” they have.
                Once the user guesses the correct number, the game is over. Keep track of the number of guesses the user makes throughout 
                the game and tell the user at the end.
            
                Extension:
                    Deal with “mice” and “mouse” and “man” and “men ” properly.
